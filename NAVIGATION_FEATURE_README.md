# Navigation Feature Implementation

This document describes the navigation feature implementation that provides turn-by-turn directions similar to Google Maps.

## Overview

The navigation system allows users to:
- Get turn-by-turn directions to destinations
- View real-time navigation with step-by-step instructions
- See route visualization on the map
- Track progress and arrival at destinations
- Save visit history when arriving at destinations

## Key Components

### 1. NavigationService (`lib/services/navigation_service.dart`)
- Core navigation logic and state management
- Handles Google Directions API integration
- Manages location tracking and step progression
- Provides streams for UI updates

### 2. NavigationOverlay (`lib/widgets/navigation_overlay.dart`)
- Displays navigation instructions during active navigation
- Shows current step, next step, and trip information
- Matches Google Maps navigation UI design
- Includes arrival notifications

### 3. NavigationMapController (`lib/widgets/navigation_map_controller.dart`)
- Controls map camera behavior during navigation
- Handles polyline updates and route visualization
- Manages camera positioning and bearing calculations

### 4. MapScreen Integration (`lib/screens/tourist/map/map_screen.dart`)
- Integrates navigation service with map display
- Handles navigation preview and start navigation
- Manages polyline display and map interactions

## Features

### Turn-by-Turn Navigation
- Real-time step-by-step directions
- Visual route display with polylines
- Current step highlighting
- Progress tracking

### Navigation UI
- Green instruction banners (like Google Maps)
- Current and next step display
- Trip information (time, distance, ETA)
- Exit navigation button
- Map controls (compass, search, volume)

### Location Tracking
- High-accuracy GPS tracking
- Automatic step progression
- Arrival detection
- Visit history saving

### Route Visualization
- Main route polyline
- Step-by-step polylines
- Current step highlighting
- Completed steps dimming

## Usage

### Starting Navigation
1. Tap on a destination marker on the map
2. Click "Navigate" in the business details modal
3. Confirm navigation in the preview modal
4. Navigation starts with turn-by-turn directions

### During Navigation
- Follow the green instruction banners
- View route on the map
- Use re-center button to return to current location
- Exit navigation using the X button

### Arrival
- Automatic arrival detection within 50 meters
- Visit saved to history
- Navigation automatically stops after 3 seconds

## Technical Details

### API Integration
- Uses Google Directions API for route calculation
- Supports walking and driving modes
- Handles polyline decoding for route visualization
- Includes proxy support for web platform

### Location Services
- High-accuracy GPS tracking
- 5-meter distance filter for updates
- Automatic permission handling
- Background location updates

### State Management
- Singleton NavigationService for app-wide state
- Stream-based updates for real-time UI
- Proper resource cleanup and disposal

## Configuration

### API Keys
- Google Directions API key configured in `lib/api/api.dart`
- Proxy server for web platform in `directions-proxy/`

### Location Settings
- High accuracy GPS
- 5-meter distance filter
- Automatic permission requests

### Navigation Settings
- 20-meter step progression threshold
- 50-meter arrival detection
- 3-second delay before stopping navigation

## Future Enhancements
